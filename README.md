# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Overview
This project is conducted by teams of two, focusing on different sorting algorithms and understanding the Big O notation for analyzing time complexities. It is a deep dive into how sorting algorithms work and their efficiency across various scenarios.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand at least four different sorting algorithms.
- Explain the Big O notation and how it applies to evaluating algorithms' time complexity.
- Determine the most suitable sorting algorithm for a given dataset.
- Define what a stable sorting algorithm is and recognize different types of sorting algorithms.
